Apache Axiom 2.0.0 Release Note
===============================

Axiom 2 introduces breaking changes to remove the dependency on `javax.activation`:

- Some classes that depend on `javax.activation` have been moved into a separate `axiom-activation`
  JAR. In some cases the package name has also been changed to avoid split packages. If you
  encounter a missing class during migration, check whether that class exists in `axiom-activation`
  and update dependencies and package names as needed.
